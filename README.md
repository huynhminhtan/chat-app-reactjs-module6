- [Redux - Thunk middleware](https://redux.js.org/): a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your application.
- [Ant.design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce): following the Ant Design specification, we developed a React UI library *antd* that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequest s and node's http interface. Besides that, it wraps the requests using a polyfill for ES6 new's promise syntax.
